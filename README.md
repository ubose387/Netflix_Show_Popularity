# Netflix Show Popularity Analysis

Description:
This data analysis project focuses on assessing the popularity of shows on Netflix by considering user ratings, show categories, and the release year. The dataset encompasses various factors, including show ratings and their correlation with user ratings, as well as user rating sizes, which indicate the user base's scale. This project not only conducts exploratory data analysis but also leverages interactive visualizations, integrating drop-down menus, labels, hover pop-ups, and more.

Key Achievements:

Exploratory Data Analysis: Explored the Netflix dataset to gain insights into show popularity based on user ratings, show categories, and release years.

Interactive Visualizations: Created interactive visualizations that enhance the data exploration experience. These visuals include drop-down menus for easy filtering, labels to provide context, and hover pop-ups to display additional information.

Word Cloud Analysis: Utilized a novel library for word cloud generation to visually represent show categories. The boldness and size of words in the word cloud reflect the relative prominence of each category.

Data Presentation: Employed MyBinder to host and share the project in a user-friendly format, making it easily accessible for future reference through a shared link.

By conducting this analysis and presenting the findings with interactive visuals and a hosted environment, this project offers valuable insights into Netflix show popularity, making it a valuable resource for those interested in the streaming platform's content trends and user preferences.
